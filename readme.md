# Dynamic array structure written in oberon!

Before testing, hey, you do have voc, right? 
Oh, no? 
Go ahead to 

```
https://github.com/vishapoberon/compiler.git
```
Read their readme file and build it for your specific system.

You can build odyno, that is, oberon dynamic structure,  by 

```
make 
``` 
This should compile and build the test program. Clean your directory with 
``` 
make clean
```
Execute the generated binary file to try what I randomly tested on it, or build and test for yourself. 

Thank you for taking a look at this.
