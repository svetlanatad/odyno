# Dynamic array structure written in oberon!

You can build it by 

```
make 
``` 
This should compile and build the test program. Clean your directory with 
``` 
make clean
```
Execute the generated binary file to try what I randomly tested on it, or build and test for yourself. 

Thank you for taking a look at this.
